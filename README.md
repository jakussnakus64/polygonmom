OpenDeFi Hackathon 2021 idea to educate and onboard new users about Polygon using a contest.


"Get your mom on Polygon" would be an on-boarding contest to conclude on mother's day, Sunday, 8 May 2022.
A start to finish tutorial for extreme non-technical users, you fill in the ""variables, example:
1. Sign up on "Coinbase", purchase x amount of Polygon.
2. Transfer Polygon and ETH to "MetaMask" wallet on Ethereum chain.
3. Delegate y amount of Polygon to a "Decentral Games", make note of the transaction hash of the stake/delegation, take a photo with your Mom.
4. Obtain Polygon on Matic network (use faucet?).
5. Go to the website, upload this information: 
-the picture of you and your Mom, formatted and cropped to a standard size. 
-trx hash of stake/delegation(maybe needs to obfuscated somehow for privacy).
6. The website will have a Polygon NFT minter app that creates 2 Matic chain NFTs of the picture with you and your mom.
7. Send 1 of those NFTs to "the contest address" and via smart contract, you will be entered to win x amount of Polygon or other crypto prizes to be determined.  If the contest is actually going to be executed as a smart contract, then Date of the drawing can only be approximated to Sunday May 8th 2022.

This could be a great way to onramp new users, educate them on some basic L2, and get more Polygons locked up in staking.  Furthermore, an onboarding contest as such, could also be an opportunity to politely harass CEXs to offer Polygon withdraws to Matic chain.  That'll pave the way for requesting the option of withdrawing other supported assets to Matic chain.  

I'm fairly new to using repos, but I will try to get a full version of the proof of concept up for comment ect. 
 In addition, I hope to have my version of the tutorial up ASAP.  I'm not an expert with any of this stuff, and I know not much Hackathon left, so if anyone would like to team up maybe could get something working.  If not, no big deal, catch it next time.
